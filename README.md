# ENERGY DASHBOARD

## Web application that displays real time and historical information on UK energy generation

## Version 1.0

## www.energydashboard.co.uk

## MOTIVATION 

Energy Dashboard was developed to provide real time and historical information on UK energy topics, with an emphasis on clearly accessible facts and figures. Initially the site centres on electricity generation, but later updates will include sections on heat generation, renewable energy, carbon emissions and transport. Energy data is constantly changing and often difficult to obtain and decipher, the plan is for Energy Dashboard to become an easy-to-use resource for anyone needing informative facts and analysis on UK energy issues.
I've worked in the renewable energy for several years, helping developers set up and finance solar, wind and biomass projects. A recent career change into coding and web development led to the development of this site, combining my background and interest in energy with my expanding web development skills.

## BACKGROUND

The Energy Dashboard application obtains live and historic energy information through freely available web API services. The application uses a chain of requests to query JSON and XML data from different sources, predominantly the UK National Grid (via Elexon). On the back end Node.js and Express.js are used and the front end utilises Chart.js to display the data and Semantic UI as the development framework, allowing a responsive / mobile-friendly layout. The application can be viewed at -  www.energydashboard.co.uk
